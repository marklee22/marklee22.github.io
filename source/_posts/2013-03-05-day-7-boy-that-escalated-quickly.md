<span style="line-height:1.5;">I haven't posted in a while, and that's simply because that meetup I went to last Thursday has snowballed into me actually enrolling in the class.  I guess the title of my blog will be misleading now and I should update it to reflect the fact that for the next 3 months, I'll be coding extensively at this place called </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" title="Hack Reactor Site" href="http://www.hackreactor.com" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>.

This is a huge investment on my part, and I'd be lying if I didn't say the financial ramifications weren't extremely mind rattling.  After much thought, a google spreadsheet listing the costs, and several conversations with the teachers, alums, and fellow friends in the industry, I came to a conclusion...
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bottom line:</strong> With or without the class, I'd get to the end of the tunnel and be a sufficient programmer.

It's just that my growth would be exponential under a regimented schedule versus learning on my own.  In the grand scheme of things money-wise, it comes out to either 3 months with the course or 9 months self-taught learning.  Being the methodical, motivated, and over-analytical bastard I am, I decided that enrolling would allow me to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn more</span>, as well as, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn faster</span>.  In essence, this was the most EFFICIENT solution, but probably not the SMARTEST solution.  If you're part of my family, you probably heavily leaned towards the latter (and that's an understatement).  If you're anyone else, you probably said "jesus, that's a lot of dough", but I support your decision.

<p>
Which brings me to my last point.  This course is 60 hours a week (plus) and 6 days a week with only Wednesdays as the off day.  There's a good (and almost certain) chance my social life will become non-existent.  I apologize ahead of time if I stop updating this blog since I start this Friday and finish June 6th.  I'll do my best to keep this updated just so you can feel like I'm still part of your lives.
