## The 6 Month Recap

Wow! It's been a little over half a year since I began my new career as a Software Engineer here at Slideshare. I've been meaning to get around to writing up a blog post about my life in the past few months, but just never got around to it. I'm going to be writing about what I've been up to lately, as well as, what I've learned engineering wise lately.

### Life Updates
First we'll get the personal life updates out of the way because most of you reading this know me personally.  First off, one of my best friends, [Scott Bonebrake](https://www.facebook.com/sbones), moved in with me.  Scott is also an engineer, but most importantly, he values what I enjoy most in life. Couch lounging, socializing, and extremely specific movie quote references. I joke with him that he'll be gone in a year since he's my 4th roommate in 4 years, but hopefully he knows I'm kidding. I'm only \***kind of**\* a terrible person... (sarcasm).

Anyways, other than that, here's a summary of what else I've been up to:
  * Back to playing soccer twice a week. We won our 7v7 Men's league last season despite being named "Unathletic Madrid".
