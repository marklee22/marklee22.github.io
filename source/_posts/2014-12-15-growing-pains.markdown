# What I've been up to
There's a reason why everyone writes a blog. Why do I write mine? Well, I'm not quite sure anymore. Clearly my posts are few and far between. Writer's block is something I experience often whenever I start a new post. It's the same unexplainable mental blank I feel when I fill out online dating profiles. Luckily for everyone, someone created Tinder and took the whole mental piece out of the picture. Unfortunately for me, Twitter is not the right medium for blogging.

Recently we just launched a new and improved "Slideview", which is our main page for consuming content here at Slideshare. It gets the majority of page views (~4 million/day), which I helped rewrite most of the code. Normally, I'd be writing a blog post about how awesome it feels to implement two redesigns for both mobile and desktop for a major website, but for some reason it doesn't feel the same this time around.

# Reflections
It's been almost a year and half since I started working here at Slideshare. When I first started I was basically one of two frontend devs in SF in a broader team of 10-15. Now our team is 8-10 and our office has 35-40 people. I've gone from first job noob to team lead in 17 months. The negative side of me thinks this is crazy; I shouldn't be leading any team based on my experience. While the other side of me is happy and proud that no matter where I go, success is something that soon follows.--I know, I know. I'm super humble...

With that success though comes more responsiblity. What I worked so hard for turned into the thing I currently dislike most about my job: being "the guy". The mission from day one has always been to become a better engineer. In order to become a better engineer, you work with people who are better than you. I can definitely say there has always been one co-worker who is better than me, but up until a month ago, every single new hire on my team  since I've been here has been less experienced than me. Slowly over time as my team expanded, my role has transitioned from being a productive engineer with tons of uninterrupted time, to more of a mentoring and review role.

Who knew working hard to learn as much as possible about a company's stack could be a bad thing? I felt like I dug myself into a hole I couldn't ever get out of. I became the "google search engine" of Slideshare frontend simply because I took a vested interest in figuring out as much as possible. After we doubled in size, I quickly became exhausted, irritated, and annoyed that no one understood what I was feeling because for the most part, I kept it to myself.

Taking the grass is always greener approach, I looked at other opportunities a few weeks back. There are simply more engineering jobs than there are engineers. It's overwhelming and stressful since it's impossible to evaluate engineering talent without working with them for weeks. However, the logical thing to do was to start over and find a team that better fits. I went from thinking about switching Slideshare teams, to joining a startup, to staying and trying to fix the issues that I didn't like. What I never thought about though was transferring to somewhere internally in LinkedIn. After failing a phone screen and an on-site, I realized two things this time around:

  1. I'm much worse at interviewing now than when I was looking for a job two years ago.

  1. Having a job and interviewing is not an efficient way to find the perfect fit for your next career move.

# Next Steps
What I've decided to do instead is switch inside LinkedIn. Learn something new with people I've worked with before under the guidance of upper management that's (hopefully) looking out for my best interests. It definitely sucks leaving a product that you've spent so much time and effort investing in to make it better, but comfort is a feeling I dislike. I can't help but feel like I'm settling when I'm comfortable. I'm too young and too type-A for that. No matter what the next venture is, one thing is certain. I'll work my ass off to make sure it doesn't fail and that's what's most important about making something successful in the future.
