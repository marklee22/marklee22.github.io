It's been a while since I've blogged lately, but that's because I've been knee deep in interviewing for the past three weeks and didn't have much to blog about. I have one more on-site interview left before I wrap up all my job applications and then I'll wait until I (hopefully) get an offer.

It's been a very interesting journey so far applying for jobs for the first time since graduating college five years ago. What I've realized is times have changed and stealing a line from Mugato in Zoolander:

### The Numbers

I'll be honest, before I applied for jobs, I thought my response rate would be ~30%. Because of this, I decided to shotgun approach the application process and shot out **32 job applications** and fielded a few recruiter calls as well. Overall, the results were pretty astonishing:

I guess I had the percentage right, but the outcome wrong. 72% of the places I applied to, gave me at least a callback, which also meant I fielded somewhere between 20-30 thirty minute (10 - 15 hours) phone calls total just to get my foot in the door. I think one or two declined a follow up, and others I felt weren't a good fit so I politely declined continuing conversations. However, about 50% of all my applications proceeded with a technical screen or coding challenge, and 60% of those brought me on-site for an interview. Overall, that's a total of 10 on-site interviews, but unfortunately that has not panned out into 10 awesome offers. That information is something I will not disclose publicly, but I'm optimistic that I'll have a great job by this time next week.

### So what's the Secret?

Was it Hack Reactor? Was it my CS-related technical degree? Did my story resonate with employers? Or am I just a good programmer and never knew it?

I'm sure it was a combination of all of the above, but I'll never know exactly. I definitely feel like being a developer in San Francisco is like being a Tickle Me Elmo 10 years ago around Christmas time. The supply is low and the demand is high, and honestly, quoting one of my teachers at Hack Reactor: "If you can write ["Hello World"][helloWorld] to a computer these days, you could probably get an interview."

I plan to follow up with a blog post about the three stages of programming interviews and what was successful and what failed. After going through so many, I feel like you could potentially "cheat the system" by simplying preparing for the types of questions they would ask. To give some context, I was given "code Fibonacci" four times in four different interviews. **Check back next week for another update**!
