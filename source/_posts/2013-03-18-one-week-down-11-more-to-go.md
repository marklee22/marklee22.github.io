It's been a while since I last posted.--my apologies.  I've removed the day counter because I no longer get to sit next to the BeastMode calendar everyday to visually track my days of unemployment.  It's Monday now (I think), which is actually midweek for us here at Hack Reactor.  Overall, the experience has been good so far.  We've gone through technologies, languages, and concepts at a blazing speed.  I find most of the coursework to be a good refresher for what I've already learned in the past, but it also fills in gaps for what I missed.

The practice of just coding for hours each day has always been my primary motivator for joining this class, and so far there has been plenty.  Here we have a very regimented schedule and more often than not Friday to Wednesday, my daily schedule is as follows:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:16px;">8am: Wake up</span></li>
	<li>9am: Arrive at Hack Reactor for breakfast</li>
	<li>9:15am-1pm: Code</li>
	<li><span style="color:#339966;">1pm-2pm: Lunch (fri, sun, tues we get 1 hour for the gym)</span></li>
	<li>2pm-5:30pm: Code</li>
	<li><span style="color:#339966;">5:30pm-6:30pm: Dinner</span></li>
	<li>6:30pm-8pm: Lecture, Review, Feedback</li>
	<li>8pm-11pm (optional): Continue on class projects, work on side projects, study, etc.</li>
</ul>
I've gone ahead and highlighted the times when I'm free in case any of you readers want to grab lunch or dinner one of these days.  Thursdays are my off day, so if you really miss me, then plan something then.

In this program, we are asked to spend 1-2 weeks on a side project, and I have a couple ideas of what I want to build.  If anyone has a (web) tool they wish they had, but doesn't exist or is poorly implemented, feel free to email me.
