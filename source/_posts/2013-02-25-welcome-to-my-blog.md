Well, it's been two days now since I went ahead and made my decision to change careers.  I've gone ahead and decided to create a blog to document my journey from traveling IT consultant to Ruby on Rails Developer.  It's going to be an arduous and fun task as I trade my previous company's perks of free Macbooks, iPhones, and lovely (heated) downtown offices for hardwork, a (soon-to-be) awesome blog, and a lot of working from home.

I'll do my best to keep this up-to-date with my progress, but just to give you all a background of what I've already learned in the past 3 months of self-learning on the side before I left:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>CodeAcademy tutorials for Javascript and jQuery</li>
	<li><a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Hartl's Rails tutorial</a></li>
	<li>My first rails site for a fantasy sports league I'm in</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll try to make this more entertaining in the future.  I imagine working from home will affect my sanity<em> just a little</em>, which may or may not add the necessary humor this blog desperately needs.
