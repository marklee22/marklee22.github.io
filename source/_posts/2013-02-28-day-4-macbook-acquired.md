Great news!  My MacBook arrived yesterday and thanks to Apple's awesome time machine restoration, I was up and running in no time with all my work transferred seamlessly.  There were some missing packages that seemed to not have transferred properly or needed to be updated, but a shout out to <a title="Homebrew" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmxcl.github.com%2Fhomebrew%2F&amp;ei=s5gvUYv1LIGriAKDw4G4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6OlsT382KquSbQwpnH6G5Rc0bqQ&amp;sig2=v2-VmpsWttwg2Bgf3mhelw&amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.cGE" target="_blank">homebrew</a> for their awesome package manager.

I'm hitting the ground running now and resumed the task of building up my github profile with various projects.  I'm open to requests if anyone has any ideas for a site they need/want made.

Also, beware that every update from here on out will most likely be technical jargon along the lines of how "I nearly threw my computer out the window trying to figure out this Rails concept".  Just know...you've now been warned!
