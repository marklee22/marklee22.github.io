<p>
Well, up until yesterday I was computer less and phone less.  Luckily, one of those things changed as my Nexus 4 finally arrived!  My MacBook Air is still being manufactured since the Apple store only carries stock MacBooks (no customizations), so I'm doing everything I can outside of working on my site.

After a quick clean up of my LinkedIn profile and finishing the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Twelve-Book-Passage-Trilogy/dp/0345504984" target="_blank">The Passage</a> (which I'd give 3 stars), I decided I'd give in and start programming on my desktop.  Rather than setup my Rails environment on Windows, I decided it'd be better to just improve my Ruby skills with various exercises and reading material.  A little cygwin, ruby 2.0.0, and notepad++ later, I'm back at hacking away at Quiz1 on www.rubyquiz.com.  I'm 99% sure that this was a project my Sophmore year in college, so it's good to know that I can solve this in a day or two rather than 2 weeks.

Also, thanks to my good friend Adam, I am tracking my days using his "Beast Mode" (the name of the pose) calendar spread.  I think I'll make it a tradition to post every new Beast Mode on the 1st of the month.
