It's a new month and my unemployment officially begins today.  Hooray?  Before I give a recap of what I've learned this week, I want to first talk about a meetup I went to last night.  The meetup was called <a href="http://www.sfruby.info/events/104937692/">Q&amp;A with Alums from Coding Schools &amp; mingle</a>, which was basically a panel of people who enrolled in these 12 week programming bootcamps to become competent Rails/Python/Javascript developers.  This was first recommended to me by my roommate who is a Ruby and Rails enthusiast, but the takeaway I got from it was that anyone can enroll in one of these schools and eventually get a job as a developer.  Obviously, it's more dependent on the person than the program, but all the interviewees were from non-programming backgrounds and now have full-time jobs in the industry.  Pretty cool stuff if you ask me.

Now back to the updates.  With every new month, comes a new "BeastMode" picture, so here it is courtesy of Adam Eversole:

The rest of my week was spent learning CSS and cleaning up my project site's look and feel.  It's crazy how much work can be dedicated to frontend styling, but it's such a necessary component for having something you're confident in showing to people.  Other than that, I've been doing a lot of the opposite of the title of this blog: socializing and not-working-as-much-as-I'd-like.  One of my best friends recently got back from the Peace Core and we had a welcome back party for him. I also went out for a few beers for trivia and darts with a few teammates on my soccer team.  I think it's important to still maintain a healthy balance of work and fun, so I guess this blog won't be completely about the overhyped loneliness I seem to emphasize.

I can't end this post like that, so I want to also say that I have an information interview with one of the teachers from Hack Reactor to try and figure out what's the most efficient way to achieve my goal.  An update to come shortly with my findings!
