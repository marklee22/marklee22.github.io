Wow! It's been a little less than a year since I began my new career as a Software Engineer here at Slideshare. I've been meaning to get around to writing up a blog post about my life in the past few months, but just never got around to it. I spent a lot of time re-adjusting back to my life after graduating Hack Reactor in June last year, and then went 110% to make sure I did my best to not fuck up while I started my new career path into full-time development. *Spoiler alert:* It's been pretty fucking awesome!

### Life Updates
I'd say for a good 6 months, my work/life balance was a little out of whack, but I still managed to do some awesome things! Rather than go into the details, here's a short summary:

  * [Scott Bonebrake](https://www.facebook.com/sbones), moved in with me here in North Beach.
  * My 7v7 Men's soccer team (Unathletic Madrid) and 11v11 coed soccer team (Ajax) won our league.
  * Some dude headbutted me while playing soccer in December and broke my nose.
  * Started training for the SF marathon this July.
  * Traveled to Boston, Vegas, LA, and Austin to visit friends and family.
  * Had an awesome three week vacation in South Korea and Malaysia with my #travelbros (FYI, we aren't bros. We use the term 'bro' in a satirical way).

### Work Updates
Okay, time to get into the section where I brag about my technical and work achievments this coming year. I think the majority of the people who read this blog are either my good friends or someone who has stumbled upon it searching for information regarding the success of graduating from Hack Reactor or bootcamps. I want to just confirm to all the people on the ropes that it was hands down **the best** investment I've made in my life, and I would make the same decision twice in a heartbeat.

I remember around this time last year, we were wrapping up HR and got a sense of everyone else's coding abilities. I never felt like I was the strongest programmer out of that class despite the fact I came in with the most experience and background. However, I knew I was one of the hardest working, and looking back at my life, that's something I've always been good at. I can hypothesize all I want of where this trait originated from, but my best guess is my father worked his ass off and my older sister was/is way smarter than me. In metaphorical sports terms, my sister is like Lebron James while I am more like Tony Parker. She is just naturally gifted, while I had to put in the time and effort to become the *somewhat* intelligent man I am today.

Over my time here at Slideshare, I've grown from a guy who was scared of stepping on people's toes...to being one of the leaders on my team. We've grown a lot this year. Our office in SF has almost doubled in size and as shocking as it sounds, I've become one of the "old guys". Figuratively and literally. I analyze every codereview, interview candidates, mentor new college grads, and even get my own intern this month (yay?). All while deploying (and fixing) features that get viewed by millions every day.

It's quite exciting still and it's a lot easier when your team is a great group of people to work with on a daily basis. Free lunch helps too. So does free sponsored events like Tough Mudders and Marathons. Seriously, working in tech is like being a spoiled child with endless access to candy. Thank god I have some self control to not eat Haribo gummi bears every day.

#### Sitemap
In my last update, I showed you my first big project I deployed. Well, since then, I've had even more success. For starters, I spent a good amount of time understanding SEO and sitemaps. This is probably an underlooked topic by most when it comes to the web. Mostly because it's a big black box at Google with countless theories. For the non-technical, it's like the "yellow pages" of your website for bots to crawl all your links. I spent a lot of time purging all the "bad links" from it to make Google stop hating on us.

#### Mobile Swipe
This is definitely my most exciting feature that took me a few months to build and perfect. We call it "mobile swipe", but it's our mobile web player that brings native swiping to all our presentations. It's responsive and works on all devices leverages several JS libraries. So far the feedback has been very good and no matter where I am, I can show people on a mobile phone or tablet what I do here.

#### Edit My Uploads
This is my most recent project. I redesigned our "My Uploads" page to be fully responsive and given it a design overhaul. We added some additional functionality to upload a Slideshare directly to your LinkedIn profile, but for the most part, we just made the page prettier.

### Last Words
I feel like if I worked at a large corporation, there's no way I'd have this many successful projects under my belt in less than a year. Maybe it's right place, right time; maybe not. One things for sure, I still plan to make a large impact on whatever I work on because programming is awesome and I would encourage anyone else to pursue it if you feel there's a passion for it.
