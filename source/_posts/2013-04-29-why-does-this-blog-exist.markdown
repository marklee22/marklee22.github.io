Recently I've been receiving some feedback that my blog has become unreadable to friends/family who are not coders. During my enrollment, the purpose of my blog changed from documenting my actual journey to showcasing my skills as a developer. I should have maintained a balance between the two since the tags in the upper right allow readers to filter between the two.

Would I would suggest is using a filter to read what interests you:

   1. Personal - Non-technical
   1. Programming - Technical


### So What's New?

I'm officially half way done with my program and the "heavy lifting" learning portion is now complete. The second half is more focused on personal and group projects while applying for jobs. It's crazy to think that it's been 6 weeks since I embarked on this adventure.

I've realized that although I still live in San Francisco, I don't feel like it because so much of my time is spent either walking to/from class and working on projects. Luckily, I've made a lot of friends here in the previous and current cohort. It kind of feels like college all over again with late nights spent in the computer lab. I've had a few nights here and there where I've seen my friends, and everytime it reminds me how much happier I am when I get the chance to see them. It's eerily similar to probably how patients in rehab feel.

### 6 Week Reflections

Because there hasn't been enough comedy in these posts, lets use some good ole self-deprecating humor of how my life has changed from living pretty to basically living off my savings. I'm not saying my life is better or worse now, but I definitely live a more **frugally sustainable** lifestyle.

#### Before
- Paid for my muni pass
- Never packed my lunch
- Budgeted $200/month for random Amazon purchases
- Went out 2-3 times a week
- Aggressively dated
- Frequented the grocery store

#### And now...
- Walk/sneak on muni and have luckily not been ticketed (yet). Hopefully they don't read my blog.
- Pack my lunch and/or dinner everyday
- Resisting the urge to order things I don't truly need
- Rarely drink or go out
- Reminisce about dating stories with my classmates
- Pickup fruit from Chinatown before class

I've gone from an average spending of $3200/month to less than $2000, which brings my actual living expenses to $800 or less excluding rent. Only now am I realizing I probably would have been a stellar accountant. Alright, time to get back to coding.  But I just want you all to know that I have a web app that I've been working on the past 2 weeks that will allow us all to hangout more often!  Check back Wednesday May 1st!
