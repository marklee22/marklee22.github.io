We have student presentations here, where a student gives a 5 minute presentation on something they found interesting that they want to present to the class.  When they were taking volunteers, I had an itch on my eyebrow, which was mistakenly taken as a hand raise.  So now I'm writing up a little excerpt on what I will be presenting later today so I can shamelessly promote my blog.

The topic of my presentation is <strong>jQuery-menu-aim</strong> <strong>and Helpful Web Resources</strong>.  I know what you're already thinking: "What does that exactly mean?"--good question.

Well, for all the non-technical people, jQuery is a utility library developed by really really ridiculously smart people to simplify how we select "stuff" on web pages via code.  I know what you're thinking now: "Yes, that's cool and all, but what about menu aim?" Well, menu-aim is like a sub-utility library built using jQuery that does even more cool and crazy stuff.  Then that developer rolls it into a package, says "hey guys, look what I did!", and other developers can now use it instead of rewriting that functionality from scratch.
<p style="text-align:left;">Rather than typing out a technical explanation of how it works, I'll perform some "blog-ception" and just link the blog post I read that describes it better than I could ever, which is <a href="http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown" target="_blank">here</a>.  For those who want the jQuery plugin, click <a href="https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
As for the helpful web resources, well, it's a compilation of cool resources I've found while browsing the interwebs that I feel can be helpful to other new and existing developers.
