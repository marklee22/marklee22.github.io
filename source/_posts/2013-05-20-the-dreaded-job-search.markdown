###The Serious Side
Well, the day is finally upon us here at Hack Reactor. The dreaded job search! Dun dun dun dunnnnn.

It's funny how it felt like only yesterday I couldn't wait for this day to come. Now that it's here, I am overwhelmed by how many companies are out there looking for good engineers. Rather than start the shotgun approach of applying to as many companies as possible, I've been spending the past few days cleaning up my blog and projects in preparation for "Hiring Day" this Thursday.

For the 25% returning visitor traffic (according to Google Analytics), you may/may not notice there are three (YES! Three!) new links in the sidebar.

- <a href="/resume">Resume</a>
- <a href="/projects">Projects</a>
- And <a href="/about">About Me</a>

I felt like it was time to put myself out there in case potential employers were interested in hiring me.

###The Hilarious Side
Earlier last week, one of the co-founders of Hack Reactor sent out an email to us to discourage us from applying to jobs. I'm not going to include the entire email, but the email chain went like so:

And my response:

I received many accolades from my colleagues for this. But in all seriousness, it's probably time to stop the jokes and start taking things a *little* bit more serious.
