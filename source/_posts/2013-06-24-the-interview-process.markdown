After going through so many interviews, I decided to blog about what the interviewing process is like for becoming a developer in this day and age. If you refer to my last post, I gave you the percentages of all the stages of each interview. Overall, I went through 30+ applications, 20 recruiter calls, 15-20 phone screens, and 11 on-site interviews. Clearly I am not great at interviewing as I received four offers total, but I do feel like I now understand the dos and don'ts of the interview process as a whole.

### Stage 1: The Resume

The first step is to take your resume. Burn it. Then build it from the ashes. I'm joking, but old Word Doc resumes are out. "Adobe In-design" templates are in. If you're not ready to pay for In-Design, there is an open-source alternative called [scribus][scribus], which I used to make my resume [here][resume]. I took two things into account when designing my resume:

1. Attention spans are short. Less is more.
1. Seeing something different will probably stand out.

Hack Reactor provides a lot of advice when creating resumes given the fact a lot of people don't have a technical work background related to programming. Luckily, I had a formal education and a job that performed technical duties, but readability was my main focus. Using my resume as an example, it was structured to have the stronger sections at the beginning and end (skills & education), and then the weaker sections (work experience) in between. Some may argue my job is more important, but given the fact I did not do much programming on the job, I felt it less applicable, so YMMV.

### Stage 2: The Application

This is straight forward. You want to send out as many applications as possible. At first I regretted doing this, but as most things go, things don't always pan out for your first or second choice and having a backup is a good idea. I noticed cover letters were optional most of the time, but if there's a box for it, **always put a cover letter**. I used a generic cover letter template that included the following:

1. A brief intro of why I was interested in the position (1-2 sentences)
1. A brief description of my skills and previous work experience/school (3-4 sentences)
1. Links to my current projects I've been working on
1. A note for them to refer to my resume for a list of my skills

What you have to realize here is that engineers (unless you're applying to startups) are not the first person to read your resume. It's a non-technical resource, so they are looking for reasons to filter you out, so don't give them any.

### Stage 3: The Recruiter Call

Depending on the size of the company, they may not have recruiters fielding this call, or may skip this call entirely. It's sole purpose is for them to weed you out. Now, what I'm about to say is not indicative of what I did, but you could literally lie about or inflate your background/skills here. What I mean by this is the sole point here is to **sell yourself to someone non-technical**. They are gauging your background by looking for keywords and seeing whether or not you'd be a good culture fit. Luckily for me, I've had 5 years of consulting background where I was on the phone constantly, so I've had some practice.

Overall, sell yourself, but still keep it honest. Just don't sell yourself short or speak negatively about yourself!

### Stage 4: The Phone Screen

The purpose of the phone screen is to arrange a conversation between yourself and an engineer. The main purpose of this call is to gauge a candidate's technical knowledge by having an engineer ask basic questions that every ____ engineer should know. The format is pretty straightforward. You can expect a 45-60 minute phone call, and possibly a second one given the size of the company.

The format is:

1. Introductions for both parties
1. Verbal questions from the engineer asking to describe simple web things that EVERY web developer should know
1. 1-4 coding problems that are domain specific (algorithms, data structures, CSS, javascript, etc.)
1. A period to ask questions about the job/company

This stage is heavy technically and less about selling yourself. Obviously, you'll want to ask some interesting questions at the end to show you're interested, but I'm assuming that is obvious.

### Stage 5: The Take Home Problem

This stage could be substituted for stage 4 or given in addition. It's what it sounds like though. An employer gives you a problem to code up in the language of your choice and submit it upon completion. These are usually projects ranging from 3-8 hours of work, and is pretty straight forward. A lot of times, the solutions can be found somewhere on the web, but it's still best to do it from scratch.

### Stage 6: The On-Site Interview

Congratulations! You've made it to the illustrious on-site interview. I could write an entire separate blog post about the on-site interview and how I don't agree with it's structure. However, there's a good chance, most of my biased opinion is based on the bitterness that I was not very good at these. Here's what I think will help calm your nerves about on-site interviews. They are simply evaluating two things: **1) How you think 2) Are you a good culture fit.**

The format is pretty straight forward. It's anywhere from 3-6 hours. You meet the team and have several 45-60 minute sessions with 1-3 people (usually just 1) where you chat, whiteboard, and/or pair program problems together. Some interviewers are really good and some are really bad. What you need to focus on is your plan of attack and that's what I'm going to write about.

What you should do when you whiteboard:

1. Take your time and think about it before you write anything on the board
1. Draw a diagram of how your solution should work
1. Figure out the edge cases first so you can plan accordingly
1. Write out pseudocode so your interviewer knows what you're thinking
1. Write the actual code carefully
1. Refactor your code, if possible

If your interviewer is good, he/she will help you along the way. If they don't and you don't know the answer, don't say "I don't know". Literally, just sit there in silence and think or say you would normally use google.

Overall, it's not about whether you get the right answer or not. It's all about the process you use to get your solution and whether you have a structured approach. Programming is very structured profession with a lot of semantics that need to be followed, so just throwing shit at the board and hoping it will stick is probably the worst thing you could do. And I definitely did that a few times just to say something to break the silence. Basically...don't do that and instead try to follow the steps I outlined above.

Best of luck, and feel free to email me if you have any other questions.
