I bet you thought I was going to stop updating this once I got a job! You were * **almost** * right...

No, but seriously, I've been really busy since starting my new job and regaining a social life. It just feels like my life is balanced again.

### Life Update

So I guess one would ask: *Mark, what the hell have you been doing since wrapping up Hack Reactor and starting at Slideshare?*

Well, I spent three weeks laying low and recharging my batteries after the 3 month marathon known as my tenure at Hack Reactor. Basically, a lot of sleeping in, a lot of socializing, and a good amount of reading Game of Thrones.

Now that I've started work, I've slowly started to get back into the groove of a schedule and it feels really good. I'm back playing soccer 2-3 times a week, finally gave in and joined Tinder, picked up my Vespa from my friend, and even joined a few tech meetups here and there. Despite having more free time compared to when I was at HR, I feel like I'm more busy than ever. Maybe it's just the fact that I basically ignored my friends for 3 months and have been playing catch up ever since.

### Job Update

Since most of my traffic comes from searches about Hack Reactor and referrals from other people's blogs, I'll get into the more important updates. I can truly say at this point that I don't think I could have made a better choice for a place to work. It's the perfect balance of cool people, cool projects, and opportunity to learn and grow.

It was slow at first fixing small bugs to get familiar with the codebase and trying to remember how to program after taking 5 weeks off in between. I had an orientation at LinkedIn down in Mountain View for my first day. Then the following day joined my team in SF where I was told to deploy on my first day. No sweat, right? Although I was basically a monkey taking directions, I was able to knock it out of the park.

What I've realized after 4 weeks of being a full-time programmer is the following:

* There's A LOT of code I didn't write. I spend a good amount of time tracing functions/callbacks all over the place
* The huge importance of writing tests to cover the previous realization
* Thank god I know a decent amount of git and BASH
* Pixel perfect designs are really important!!!
* Mobile responsiveness and Google Analytics are critical things to have working properly


And on a less serious note:

* I'm not particularly good at foosball when spinning is involved
* Free soft drinks, beef jerky, and gummi bears are going to be the death of me
* Perks at a big company are awesome
* You do 20 pushups everytime your deploy breaks the site. -- I've done 40 so far

### My First Change

It took me a while, but my first "real" addition to the site is a share modal to share slideshows across your networks. My team is responsible for revamping the consumer experience for Slideshare, and we hope the new designs we're rolling out will improve the browse and share the experiences for our logged in users. You can find my new modal by clicking the "Share" button on a presentation [here][newlist].

Well, there's the update for now. I'll keep alternating between technical and non-technical posts in the future.
