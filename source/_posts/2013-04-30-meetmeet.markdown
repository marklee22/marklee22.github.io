Ten days ago, I embarked on my first balls-to-the-wall hacking experience and I'm pretty proud of the outcome.  It's a site I call (for now) "MeetMeet", which can be viewed [here][meetmeet].

We were given 4 days to work on our personal project, but over our one week break, I thought it would be best to get a headstart after looking at my list of features I wanted to implement. I think the main lesson I learned is that the term "MVP" does not stand for "MOST valuable product".  It stands for "MINIMUM viable product".  However, I think I have a fully (yet a little buggy) web app built in [Meteor.js][meteor].

#What the app does

This is an idea I've had for a while that I never had time to pursue.  Originally, I actually wanted to make a native iOS app, but am now glad I made a somewhat-responsive web app instead. The amount of functionality built into 10 days is impressive by my standards, and I can only attribute Meteor's intuitive and easy to use framework for it. Enough technical jargon. Let's dive into the details.

Here's how it works (and there's a section on the site explaining this):

1. Create an account
1. Hook up your Google Calendar and Facebook Friends
1. Select your meeting preferences
1. Pick who you want to meet from your Facebook Friends
1. Let MeetMeet auto schedule events based on 'mutually anonymous agreements' and free time on your schedule

A pretty basic and straightforward process that I can hopefully build more features for. I have declared it an alpha because I've barely had time to test it fully, but from what I can tell, it should work (**knock on wood**).

Anyways, it's 12am now, I just deployed it, and I'm the last one here at Hack Reactor. Feel free to sign up and check it out.
