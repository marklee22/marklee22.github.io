  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello everyone,
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Mark Lee and I'm a full stack developer. The original intention of this blog was meant to document my journey from IT consultant to developer. However, like most things in life, nothing goes as planned. Some may notice that the purpose of this blog shifted from originally documenting my funemployment for my friends, to now showcasing my skills as a developer to the world wide web. If you're really into examples of why engineers should be given more writing courses, technical posts, and a lot of rambling...then this blog is meant for you!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're one of those people who is determining whether you want to hire me. You should. I'm pretty awesome both as a developer and an individual. My hobbies include: sports, tech, reading, memorizing digits of Pi (I'm at 18), and breaking awkward silence using my sense of humor.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get in contact with me, my email is listed in my <a href="/resume">resume</a>. Feel free to follow up with any questions or inquiries.
