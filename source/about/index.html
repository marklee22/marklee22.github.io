  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello everyone,
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from UCSB in 2008 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Almost immediately, I started working as an IT consultant/Developer for a company called Novacoast. After five years of consulting, I felt a slight itch to play around with development again, and began playing around with iPhone and Rails development on the side. After spending more and more of my free-time using available online resources, I ultimately came to the conclusion that I would leave my job and dedicate learning as a full-time job.
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally, I gave myself a goal of 6-9 months before I would re-enter the workforce as a software engineer. However, only two weeks in, I met the co-founder of a "code school" called <a href="www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>. Soon after two long meetings, I decided to enroll and now the rest is history!
  </p>
  <p>
    The intention of this blog was meant originally to document my journey, but instead, has become a mix of my journey and establishing a web presence for the technology I am learning here at Hack Reactor.
