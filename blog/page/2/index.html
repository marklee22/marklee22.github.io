	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been receiving some feedback that my blog has become unreadable to friends/family who are not coders. During my enrollment, the purpose of my blog changed from documenting my actual journey to showcasing my skills as a developer. I should have maintained a balance between the two since the tags in the upper right allow readers to filter between the two.</p>

<p>Would I would suggest is using a filter to read what interests you:</p>

<ol>
<li>. Personal &ndash; Non-technical</li>
<li>. Programming &ndash; Technical</li>
</ol>


<h3>So What&rsquo;s New?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m officially half way done with my program and the &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; learning portion is now complete. The second half is more focused on personal and group projects while applying for jobs. It&rsquo;s crazy to think that it&rsquo;s been 6 weeks since I embarked on this adventure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that although I still live in San Francisco, I don&rsquo;t feel like it because so much of my time is spent either walking to/from class and working on projects. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve made a lot of friends here in the previous and current cohort. It kind of feels like college all over again with late nights spent in the computer lab. I&rsquo;ve had a few nights here and there where I&rsquo;ve seen my friends, and everytime it reminds me how much happier I am when I get the chance to see them. It&rsquo;s eerily similar to probably how patients in rehab feel.</p>

<h3>6 Week Reflections</h3>

<p>Because there hasn&rsquo;t been enough comedy in these posts, lets use some good ole self-deprecating humor of how my life has changed from living pretty to basically living off my savings. I&rsquo;m not saying my life is better or worse now, but I definitely live a more <strong>frugally sustainable</strong> lifestyle.</p>

<h4>Before</h4>

<ul>
<li>Paid for my muni pass</li>
<li>Never packed my lunch</li>
<li>Budgeted $200/month for random Amazon purchases</li>
<li>Went out 2-3 times a week</li>
<li>Aggressively dated</li>
<li>Frequented the grocery store</li>
</ul>


<h4>And now&hellip;</h4>

<ul>
<li>Walk/sneak on muni and have luckily not been ticketed (yet). Hopefully they don&rsquo;t read my blog.</li>
<li>Pack my lunch and/or dinner everyday</li>
<li>Resisting the urge to order things I don&rsquo;t truly need</li>
<li>Rarely drink or go out</li>
<li>Reminisce about dating stories with my classmates</li>
<li>Pickup fruit from Chinatown before class</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from an average spending of $3200/month to less than $2000, which brings my actual living expenses to $800 or less excluding rent. Only now am I realizing I probably would have been a stellar accountant. Alright, time to get back to coding.  But I just want you all to know that I have a web app that I&rsquo;ve been working on the past 2 weeks that will allow us all to hangout more often!  Check back Wednesday May 1st!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time the past couple of weeks learning a lot of new languages, technologies, and concepts.  One that I have  particularly been focusing on is <a href="">Backbone.js</a>, which is a fairly complicated library for such a small amount of code.  I just want to make it clear that this is not a post about how Backbone works, but instead is meant more as tips or &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; for what I found difficult learning Backbone from scratch.</p>

<h3>Break out your code</h3>

<p>Backbone forces you to provide structure around your javascript code.  You might as well go the extra step and create a standard folder structure to separate each Class because it&rsquo;s a good habit to have.  I set up a simple folder structure before I start every project for models, collections, and views to make includes easier.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">

</div>


<h3>You should know Underscore.js</h3>

<p>Backbone is written by the same developer who wrote <a href="">Underscore.js</a> and the majority of the Underscore functionality has been rolled into Backbone for models and collections.  It&rsquo;s worth the hour or so to study Underscore to help utilize these helpers instead of writing your own for loops and callbacks.</p>

<h3>Collections cannot hold attributes/properties</h3>

<p>I learned this the hard way, but you cannot call <code>this.set('attribute') = 'blah'</code> on a collection.  Collections are meant only to hold models and you&rsquo;ll get various errors if you try and call set/get methods on collections.</p>

<h3>Use triggers when children models need to communicate with the parent/grandparent</h3>

<p>I spent the good first few hours asking myself &ldquo;how can I get that model to do something based on another model?&rdquo;.  With several layers of models and collections, it&rsquo;s hard to picture how a lower tiered model communicates up the event chain.  Well, Backbone uses events and triggers to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Say I have an app model that holds a collection of card models.  In order for card to communicate with app, my collection would have a function that evaluates the state of a card or cards, and trigger an event if that condition is met.  Then in the app model, I would listen for that specific event to fire, and specify a callback to perform some action on my app.</p>

<p>Using my Blackjack App as an example, the app (model) listens for a player hand (collection), which checks each card (model) to determine if a player has blackjack or loses.  See the example below:</p>

<p>Hand Collection function to evaluate a player&rsquo;s total score</p>

<h3>jQuery event handlers are only initiated once</h3>

<p>When your view is initialized, any event handlers declared in your events hash or initialize function will only be initialized once and inserted into the DOM.  If you end up deleting or replacing your html in your render function (For example: calling <code>this.$el.html([some rendered html]))</code>), your jQuery event handlers will be blown away.  In order to preserve these handlers, you would have to re-create them when you re-render your page.  A simple alternative to solve this however is to call <code>this.$el.children().detach()</code> to safely detach and reattach your jQuery children event handlers.</p>

<h3>Collection.fetch() resets your collection</h3>

<p>Backbone has implemented code that uses jQuery.ajax.  If you&rsquo;re switching over to Backbone models and have previous ajax calls defined, you&rsquo;ll have to utilize the url property on your Collection/Models and call fetch() to pull the data down from the server.  The one thing I discovered is everytime you fetch your data from the server, the default action is to reset the collection.  I believe you can get around this by setting some flags in your options hash and/or defining your own Collection.parse function.  In general though, it&rsquo;s best to fetch once and sync data thereafter rather than fetching multiple times from your server.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s all from me (for now).  Hopefully someone will find this useful because Backbone is a tough concept to learn.  By no means am I an expert with Backbone, but I&rsquo;m going to continue to practice more with it.</p>

With today&rsquo;s post, I bring to you my first interactive game written entirely in javascript.  As always if you&rsquo;re non-technical, feel free to jump straight to the bottom of this post to see the app.  I really enjoyed this project because I was able to accomplish three things I&rsquo;ve been meaning to spend more time on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get more practice with <a href="http://backbonejs.org" title="Backbone.js">Backbone.js</a></li>
<li>Play around with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" title="CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a></li>
<li>Develop code using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" title="TDD">test driven strategy</a> (TDD)</li>
</ul>


<h3>TDD</h3>

<p>Testing is a newfound concept for me when it comes to programming, but I am constantly improving my ability to write good test coverage for all my projects here.  For this project specifically, I decided to use <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/" title="Jasmine">Jasmine</a> as my testing suite.  I found two things key to writing tests for Backbone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn how spies work.  Seriously, it is the key to the puzzle</li>
<li>Build my tests from the bottom up, meaning I focus on the lowest level models first and proceed up the model chain</li>
</ul>


<p>What I&rsquo;m finding out here at Hack Reactor is that no one enjoys testing except me.  I think it&rsquo;s one part OCD and one part understanding that it&rsquo;s the agile way.  I feel like despite it doubled my implementation time, it made me think long and hard about how the application should work.  Once I figured out how spies work and where to initialize them, I was quickly moving through additional tests involving triggers and chained function calls.</p>

<h3>CoffeeScript vs Javascript</h3>

<p>In case you&rsquo;ve never heard of CoffeeScript, it is quintessentially what C is to Assembly.  It abstracts the javascript language and provides several helpers or &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; that eventually compiles into javascript code.  I think using CoffeeScript or Javascript is simply a matter of taste.  Although I enjoyed writing less lines of code and <em>not</em> having to use semi-colons.  The browser still runs on javascript, and when something breaks, I have to dig through the compiled JS files to backtrace what line of CoffeeScript is failing.  <em>Bottom line though</em>: You should probably be familiar with both.</p>

<p>I definitely see the advantages of writing CoffeeScript, and wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if more and more companies use it in the future.  I&rsquo;m just not a fan of optional parentheses and replacing &lsquo;this&rsquo; with &lsquo;@&rsquo;.  It doesn&rsquo;t look right to me yet coming from years of coding in C++, Java, and PHP, but over time I could see myself changing my sentiment.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a basic example here of the hit() method for a Hand.</p>

<h5>CoffeeScript</h5>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">hit: </span><span class="nf">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">@add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">@deck</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pop</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="nx">last</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">@scores</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">every</span> <span class="nf">(score) -&gt;</span> <span class="nx">score</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h5>Javascript Equivalent</h5>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">Hand</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prototype</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scores</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">every</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">score</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">score</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">})))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">deck</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pop</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="nx">last</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see CoffeeScript is concise, clean, and less characters overall.  I&rsquo;m just not &lsquo;fluent&rsquo; in the language yet, so in my brain I am converting the CoffeeScript to javascript anyways.</p>

<h3>Backbone Models/Collections/Views</h3>

<p>Overall, there are three model classes in play here:</p>

<ol>
<li> App &ndash; Top level model that controls the game functionality with the player/dealer</li>
<li> Deck &ndash; Collection of 52 unique Card models</li>
<li> DiscardPile &ndash; Collection of Card models that is initially empty for holding all previously played cards</li>
<li> Hand &ndash; Collection of Cards with helper methods like hit, stand, getScore, etc.</li>
<li> Card &ndash; Base model representing a card (suit and value)</li>
</ol>


<p>Since our app will only display the app, hand, and cards, I only needed View classes for those models.  I feel the hardest part about learning Backbone is to understand what code goes where, and once you engrain the idea that you should avoid logic in views, it becomes much easier to visualize the file structure.</p>

<p>I found testing to be a big help for this project specifically.  Normally, I&rsquo;d make a code change, refresh the web browser, and simulate the user functionality I implemented manually.  With extensive tests, I simply changed that process to verify all my tests are still passing in case I broke something unexpectedly.  Of course at the end, I decided to spend a few hours cleaning up the UX/UI to polish it up.  It&rsquo;s amazing how 1-2 hours of CSS work + images + animations can make something look that much better.  I used to hate doing CSS, but I&rsquo;m starting to grow fond of it as it is the final layer of polish to every application.  I also decided to use sprites for the card images instead of individual images.  It&rsquo;s an interesting concept that I learned reading a blog in <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming" title="Programming">reddit programming</a> which is a concept I&rsquo;m sure will come in handy in the future!</p>

<h3>Now for the app itself!</h3>

<p>This is a basic Blackjack application.  It does not support <em>betting</em> (unfortunately), <em>splits</em>, or <em>dealer insurance</em>.  I hope you enjoy this and eventually I will release the gist when the repo is public after my program at Hack Reactor is complete.  Check back soon!</p>

Using the free and easy-to-use hosting platform <a href="heroku.com">Heroku</a>, you can browse to my web app right now <a class="big" href="http://infinite-caverns-3250.herokuapp.com/">here!</a></p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/chatbot-1.png" width="500" height="500"></p>

<h3>So How Does it Work (from a technical standpoint)?</h3>


<ol>
  <li>A user browses to the website and subsequently submits an HTTP request</li>
  <li>Node server processes request and serves up HTML/JS/CSS pages</li>
  <li>jQuery/Javascript binds event handlers and callbacks to various DOM nodes and actions</li>
  <li>Using AJAX, Javascript periodically polls the server for new messages</li>
</ol>


<h3>Alright Mark, but what about for all us non-programmers?</h3>


<p>Right.  The features of what I implemented.  Basically, this is the next GoogleTalk in the making&#8230;  Well, not really, but it was a great project for learning more about ajax, Node.js, and the client-server programming paradigm.  A couple features that I implemented:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Room and Friend list updates dynamically with who has submitted chats</li>
  <li>Multiple chat rooms are supported, however, it has to be run manually (for now) by browsing to a url like http://infinite-caverns-3250.herokuapp.com/classes/&lt;roomName&gt;</li>
  <li>Chat room filtering of messages</li>
  <li>&#8220;Friend list&#8221; highlighting</li>
  <li>And of course, the ability to chat with others over the web</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a small snippet of the client side send message function:</p>

		<p>Given my new web skills, I decided to switch blogs!  Although, Wordpress was a great way to start my blogging career, I wanted something a little more customizable to allow me to include some of the projects I&#8217;ve been working on lately.  I switched to <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is based on the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll blog static-page framework</a>.</p>


<p>  I&rsquo;m now using github to host my blog which also allows free hosting.  I&rsquo;ve only just started playing around with what Octopress has to offer, but so far I&rsquo;m impressed how easy it was to setup.  Overall, it probably took me 3-4 hours to get everything setup and migrated.  I guess the one drawback is I lost the nifty spell checker before I post, so maybe if I&rsquo;m really bored, I&rsquo;ll work on a javascript or Ruby plugin to catch any errors in the future.</p>

<p>In case you just found my blog, below is what it used to look like.  As you can see it&#8217;s boring, shows little customization, and says I am both lonely and working from home, which is now no longer the case!</p>

		<p>
It&#8217;s been a while since I last posted.&#8211;my apologies.  I&#8217;ve removed the day counter because I no longer get to sit next to the BeastMode calendar everyday to visually track my days of unemployment.  It&#8217;s Monday now (I think), which is actually midweek for us here at Hack Reactor.  Overall, the experience has been good so far.  We&#8217;ve gone through technologies, languages, and concepts at a blazing speed.  I find most of the coursework to be a good refresher for what I&#8217;ve already learned in the past, but it also fills in gaps for what I missed.
</p>




<p>
The practice of just coding for hours each day has always been my primary motivator for joining this class, and so far there has been plenty.  Here we have a very regimented schedule and more often than not Friday to Wednesday, my daily schedule is as follows:
<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:16px;">8am: Wake up</span></li>
    <li>9am: Arrive at Hack Reactor for breakfast</li>
    <li>9:15am-1pm: Code</li>
    <li><span style="color:#339966;">1pm-2pm: Lunch (fri, sun, tues we get 1 hour for the gym)</span></li>
    <li>2pm-5:30pm: Code</li>
    <li><span style="color:#339966;">5:30pm-6:30pm: Dinner</span></li>
    <li>6:30pm-8pm: Lecture, Review, Feedback</li>
    <li>8pm-11pm (optional): Continue on class projects, work on side projects, study, etc.</li>
</ul>
I&#8217;ve gone ahead and highlighted the times when I&#8217;m free in case any of you readers want to grab lunch or dinner one of these days.  Thursdays are my off day, so if you really miss me, then plan something then.
</p>




<p>
In this program, we are asked to spend 1-2 weeks on a side project, and I have a couple ideas of what I want to build.  If anyone has a (web) tool they wish they had, but doesn&#8217;t exist or is poorly implemented, feel free to email me.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>
We have student presentations here, where a student gives a 5 minute presentation on something they found interesting that they want to present to the class.  When they were taking volunteers, I had an itch on my eyebrow, which was mistakenly taken as a hand raise.  So now I&#8217;m writing up a little excerpt on what I will be presenting later today so I can shamelessly promote my blog.
</p>




<div class="aligncenter">
  <img src="/images/posts/student-presentation-1.png" width="255" height="300">
  <span class="caption">&#8220;Bad Luck Brian&#8221;</span>
</div>




<p>
The topic of my presentation is <strong>jQuery-menu-aim</strong> <strong>and Helpful Web Resources</strong>.  I know what you&#8217;re already thinking: &#8220;What does that exactly mean?&#8221;&#8211;good question.
</p>




<p>
Well, for all the non-technical people, jQuery is a utility library developed by really really ridiculously smart people to simplify how we select &#8220;stuff&#8221; on web pages via code.  I know what you&#8217;re thinking now: &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s cool and all, but what about menu aim?&#8221; Well, menu-aim is like a sub-utility library built using jQuery that does even more cool and crazy stuff.  Then that developer rolls it into a package, says &#8220;hey guys, look what I did!&#8221;, and other developers can now use it instead of rewriting that functionality from scratch.
</p>




<p>Rather than typing out a technical explanation of how it works, I&#8217;ll perform some &#8220;blog-ception&#8221; and just link the blog post I read that describes it better than I could ever, which is <a href="http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown" target="_blank">here</a>.  For those who want the jQuery plugin, click <a href="https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>




<p>
As for the helpful web resources, well, it&#8217;s a compilation of cool resources I&#8217;ve found while browsing the interwebs that I feel can be helpful to other new and existing developers.
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://overapi.com/" target="_blank">A list of all the APIs for web languages</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/" target="_blank">Programming sub-reddit</a> (follow this sub)</li>

<p>
<span style="line-height:1.5;">I haven&#8217;t posted in a while, and that&#8217;s simply because that meetup I went to last Thursday has snowballed into me actually enrolling in the class.  I guess the title of my blog will be misleading now and I should update it to reflect the fact that for the next 3 months, I&#8217;ll be coding extensively at this place called </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" title="Hack Reactor Site" href="http://www.hackreactor.com" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>.
</p>




<p>
This is a huge investment on my part, and I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t say the financial ramifications weren&#8217;t extremely mind rattling.  After much thought, a google spreadsheet listing the costs, and several conversations with the teachers, alums, and fellow friends in the industry, I came to a conclusion&#8230;

<strong>Bottom line:</strong> With or without the class, I&#8217;d get to the end of the tunnel and be a sufficient programmer.
</p>




<p>
It&#8217;s just that my growth would be exponential under a regimented schedule versus learning on my own.  In the grand scheme of things money-wise, it comes out to either 3 months with the course or 9 months self-taught learning.  Being the methodical, motivated, and over-analytical bastard I am, I decided that enrolling would allow me to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn more</span>, as well as, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn faster</span>.  In essence, this was the most EFFICIENT solution, but probably not the SMARTEST solution.  If you&#8217;re part of my family, you probably heavily leaned towards the latter (and that&#8217;s an understatement).  If you&#8217;re anyone else, you probably said &#8220;jesus, that&#8217;s a lot of dough&#8221;, but I support your decision.
</p>




<p>
Which brings me to my last point.  This course is 60 hours a week (plus) and 6 days a week with only Wednesdays as the off day.  There&#8217;s a good (and almost certain) chance my social life will become non-existent.  I apologize ahead of time if I stop updating this blog since I start this Friday and finish June 6th.  I&#8217;ll do my best to keep this updated just so you can feel like I&#8217;m still part of your lives.

It&#8217;s a new month and my unemployment officially begins today.  Hooray?  Before I give a recap of what I&#8217;ve learned this week, I want to first talk about a meetup I went to last night.  The meetup was called <a href="http://www.sfruby.info/events/104937692/">Q&amp;A with Alums from Coding Schools &amp; mingle</a>, which was basically a panel of people who enrolled in these 12 week programming bootcamps to become competent Rails/Python/Javascript developers.  This was first recommended to me by my roommate who is a Ruby and Rails enthusiast, but the takeaway I got from it was that anyone can enroll in one of these schools and eventually get a job as a developer.  Obviously, it&#8217;s more dependent on the person than the program, but all the interviewees were from non-programming backgrounds and now have full-time jobs in the industry.  Pretty cool stuff if you ask me.
</p>


<p>
Now back to the updates.  With every new month, comes a new &#8220;BeastMode&#8221; picture, so here it is courtesy of Adam Eversole:

The rest of my week was spent learning CSS and cleaning up my project site&#8217;s look and feel.  It&#8217;s crazy how much work can be dedicated to frontend styling, but it&#8217;s such a necessary component for having something you&#8217;re confident in showing to people.  Other than that, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of the opposite of the title of this blog: socializing and not-working-as-much-as-I&#8217;d-like.  One of my best friends recently got back from the Peace Core and we had a welcome back party for him. I also went out for a few beers for trivia and darts with a few teammates on my soccer team.  I think it&#8217;s important to still maintain a healthy balance of work and fun, so I guess this blog won&#8217;t be completely about the overhyped loneliness I seem to emphasize.
</p>


<p>
I can&#8217;t end this post like that, so I want to also say that I have an information interview with one of the teachers from Hack Reactor to try and figure out what&#8217;s the most efficient way to achieve my goal.  An update to come shortly with my findings!

Great news!  My MacBook arrived yesterday and thanks to Apple&#8217;s awesome time machine restoration, I was up and running in no time with all my work transferred seamlessly.  There were some missing packages that seemed to not have transferred properly or needed to be updated, but a shout out to <a title="Homebrew" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmxcl.github.com%2Fhomebrew%2F&amp;ei=s5gvUYv1LIGriAKDw4G4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6OlsT382KquSbQwpnH6G5Rc0bqQ&amp;sig2=v2-VmpsWttwg2Bgf3mhelw&amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.cGE" target="_blank">homebrew</a> for their awesome package manager.

<p>
I&#8217;m hitting the ground running now and resumed the task of building up my github profile with various projects.  I&#8217;m open to requests if anyone has any ideas for a site they need/want made.

<p>
Also, beware that every update from here on out will most likely be technical jargon along the lines of how &#8220;I nearly threw my computer out the window trying to figure out this Rails concept&#8221;.  Just know&#8230;you&#8217;ve now been warned!
