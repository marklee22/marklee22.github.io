	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A week ago, I finished my first ever marathon with a painful time of 3:30:42. I&rsquo;m ecstatic. It&rsquo;s about 15 minutes faster than I hoped for, or a little more than ~30 seconds faster per mile than what I trained for. Despite that, 42 seconds is going to haunt me for quite some time. A lot of people have asked me what it was like, so I decided I&rsquo;d write a recount of events of the whole thing from start to finish.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/marathon_course.png"></p>

<h2>Pre-Race</h2>

<h3>3:15am</h3>

<p>For some reason I wake up at 3am; an hour before my alarm. As I get up and change, I hear my roommate returning home from the bars which I find hilarious. I prep my breakfast of a bagel with peanut butter, a banana, and a blue Gatorade. I fill up my camelbak, put in my contacts, and hop on my Vespa to pick-up my bib from my work since they picked them up for us the day before.</p>

<h3>4:30am</h3>

<p>I am told I should pick my bib up from the bus coming from LinkedIn HQ in Mountain View between Howard and Harrison. Well, I get there on time and low and behind, no one is here. And it&rsquo;s still pitch dark. I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I am a little worried that they are going to be late and I won&rsquo;t have my bib in time. Like every other time I worry though, it all works out and the bus arrives 10 minutes later.</p>

<h3>4:50am</h3>

<p>My co-worker&rsquo;s boyfriend works right by the start line, so I decide to take up his offer of using their bathrooms before the race. I&rsquo;ll skip the details, but two words: life saver.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/start-line.jpg"></p>

<h3>5:15am</h3>

<p>I arrive at the RUN365 tent and I start to feel the nerves. There is an absurd amount of people here and the sun hasn&rsquo;t even come up. I&rsquo;m starting to get nervous about things like not hydrating enough, only having 3 hours of sleep, and whether I&rsquo;m going to have to use the bathroom during the race. My official wave is wave 4 which had an average pace of 9:00 &ndash; 9:30, but instead decide that I&rsquo;d rather start at the pace I plan to run, which is 8:15 &ndash; 8:45 in wave 2.</p>

<h3>5:30am</h3>

<p>The first wave is off. I hop the fence in our private booth to jump in the wave and target the 3:45 total time pacing group. I turn on my marathon playlist that I made and start my Nike+ run tracker. I exit the gates 4 minutes later after the gun and think to myself, &ldquo;well, here goes nothing&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/pre-race.jpg" width="250" height="325"></p>

<h2>The Race</h2>

<h3>Mile 4 (The Marina)</h3>

<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m in the Marina chugging at about an 8:15min/mile pace. I&rsquo;m still with the 3:45 pacing group and can&rsquo;t help but notice that there are a lot of cute girls in my group and they are all super fit. But I didn&rsquo;t sign up for this race to meet women. I signed up to cross this off my bucket list AND beat my friends&#8217; times. I&rsquo;ve been taking one shot block every mile at this point and start to feel more tired than I usually feel at mile 4. I assume it&rsquo;s the lack of sleep more so than the faster pace.</p>

<h3>Mile 5 (The Hill before the GG Bridge)</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what hit me, but my mentality changes from this point forward. I start going up the hill before the bridge and something in my mind clicks: I want to run faster up this hill than the pacing group. I have been running these hills for 2 months and feel like I can maintain my pace going up them. I slowly start to speed up and leave them behind.</p>

<h3>Mile 9 (The GG Bridge)</h3>

<p>Coming back over the bridge, there&rsquo;s a slight downhill. I decide that I should try and take advantage of the grade and start to elongate my strides and run a bit faster. At this point, I am consistently passing people and the groups have thinned out significantly. Every water station, I grab one cup electrolytes and two cups water to save the water in my camelbak for the remaining hills/end of the race. I still feel tired, but I tell myself the hardest part is over and there&rsquo;s a long downhill coming up.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/gg-bridge.jpg" width="250" height="325"></p>

<h3>Mile 13 (GG Park)</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel good anymore. The smiles for the cameras have disappeared and I feel soaked in sweat from head to toe. I&rsquo;m doubting that I&rsquo;ll be able to finish the race at this pace and I should slow down, but I don&rsquo;t. I just tell myself instead that I&rsquo;m halfway done and I just need to get through GG park to get to the flat parts of the race where I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<h3>Mile 14 (GG Park)</h3>

<p>My Mom and her fiance said they&rsquo;d be here. At the mile marker, they aren&rsquo;t here, so I assume they must be further down the road. My Nike tracker is telling me that I&rsquo;m running at a 7:58 mile pace, so I now know I&rsquo;m on target to be below 3:30 and keep trying to bring that time down as the race goes on. About half a mile later I see my folks. They aren&rsquo;t ready at all and when I wave at them, they scramble out of surprise to take a photo and show me the big heads they made of me. I give my Mom a hug and then sprint back into the race to make up for the lost time.</p>

<h3>Mile 15 (GG Park)</h3>

<p>More hills! I can&rsquo;t believe how many god damn hills there are in this course. I&rsquo;ve run this part before, but haven&rsquo;t since my last long run of 24 miles three weeks ago. Surprisingly, I see the fastest guy in my training group ahead of me who said he was going for sub 3:30 before the race. I walk up behind him and say, &ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d catch you&rdquo;, and pass him. Yeah, I know, I&rsquo;m kind of a dick, but in my defense, I said to him that I might catch him later. I didn&rsquo;t actually mean it when I said it though.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/gg-park.jpg" width="250" height="325"></p>

<h3>Mile 19 (Panhandle)</h3>

<p>Holy balls, I&rsquo;m out of the park! Thank god because I only have one pack of shot bloks left and my legs feel really heavy. Oh wait&hellip;no, I don&rsquo;t have those shot bloks because they apparently fell out of your camelbak. I panic a little because I feel like they give me a huge burst of energy everytime I eat one. Most likely it is pyschological, but luckily I remembered there is a GU station coming up in the Haight and I could just grab some food/energy there instead.</p>

<h3>Mile 23 (Potrero Hill)</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m cramping up in my hammys and calves. It&rsquo;s not to the point where I can&rsquo;t walk, but it&rsquo;s sharp pains that hit me sporadically. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt for more than a split second, and I imagine I look like something is shocking me in the ass. I&rsquo;ve eaten both my GUs at this point and figure I&rsquo;m about to run out of gas soon. However, I&rsquo;m counting down the miles at this point, telling myself I only have X left. Also every time I cramp up, I am verbally saying out loud: &ldquo;mind over body&rdquo; and &ldquo;you got this&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s another hill coming up on 16th and I feel like my body is about to break down going up this thing, but then miraculously Journey comes on with &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop Believing&rdquo;. It is like Manifest destiny and I keep my pace going up the hill.</p>

<h3>Mile 25 (The Ballpark)</h3>

<p>This girl keeps passing me and I keep passing her. I&rsquo;m not sure if we&rsquo;re both ultra competitve or my pace is fluctuating up and down. I&rsquo;m feeling the cramps more often now, and am willing myself to the finish line. I see a lot of people walking and two guys who are laying on the ground from exhaustion. Nike+ is telling me my pace is 7:52, but I know it&rsquo;s wrong because the mile markers are about a quarter mile off. I am too tired to do the math in my head, but I think I&rsquo;ll be before 3:30, which is now the new goal.</p>

<p>As I look up, I see a guy in the distance from my running program who I wanted to run with pre-race but his target time was too fast for me. I am slowly catching up to him until I finally catch up to him to say, &ldquo;surprise, I guess I should have paced with you&rdquo;. His response was, &ldquo;damn dude, you&rsquo;re fast&rdquo;. We are passing the ballpark at this point and I ask if we&rsquo;re going to beat 3:30 and he says yes. I am assuming he started in front of me, so I trust him, but I still feel like I have some more left in the tank.</p>

<h3>Mile 26 (The Embarcadero)</h3>

<p>The sun is shining, you can hear the cheers in the distance, and I know I only have the equivalence of one lap around the track left. I pretty much feel a cramping sensation in one of my muscles every 10 seconds and it sucks. As I get closer to the finish line, the cheering makes my adrenaline start pumping. What&rsquo;s the most logical thing to do at this point? Well, it&rsquo;s quite simple&hellip;sprint. Yes, I kid you not. I decide to sprint the last 200m of the finish line. I wish I had a video because I felt like that is probably one of the most physically grueling things I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life and my face shows it.</p>

<h3>The Finish Line</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2014-08-03/finish-line.jpg" width="250" height="325"></p>

<p>I cross the finish line with a half-smile across my face and slow down to a halt right after crossing. Well, immediately both my legs cramp up completely and I fall down to a crouch. I&rsquo;m sitting there for 2 seconds wondering if I can get up, but a lady comes up to me and asks if I&rsquo;m alright and that I need to move out of the way. I tell her ok and look up only to see someone wheeling a wheelchair towards me. I laugh and wave it off. Then hobble my way away from the finish line. Every step hurts at this point, I feel like my nipples were grinded with a cheese grader, and there&rsquo;s a knot in my shoulder like I&rsquo;ve never felt before. I stop my run tracker and see it&rsquo;s 3:31 and I can&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;dammit&rdquo; at first, but I&rsquo;m still really proud of myself. I grab a boxed water and coconut water and then proceed to get brunch with my parents after.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The question I always get is: <strong>Will you run a marathon again?</strong></p>

<p>Right now there&rsquo;s no specific race I want to do. I would say that if someone challenged me to one, I would definitely consider it, but I trained for more than half a year. That is an absurd amount of time looking back and I&rsquo;m honestly glad it&rsquo;s over so I can go back and pursue other goals of mine.</p>

<p>I will say that completing a marathon is no easy task. Qualifying for Boston is probably impossible. I&rsquo;m glad that I can cross this achievement off my bucket list, and am greatly thankful for all the support I got from my friends and family. Looking back, there were countless runs I did hungover on Saturday mornings. Many injuries that I had to overcome from bad shoes and running too fast. I think what I learned the most from this race is that I can do anything I put my mind to. Whether it&rsquo;s physically or mentally challenging, and I can only attribute that to the values instilled in me from my upbringing. If my family wasn&rsquo;t all so god damn competitive, there&rsquo;s no way I would have finished that without walking a bit. I now am the only one in my family to run a marathon and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;ll be that way for a while :). In closing, I just want to say once again, thanks all who supported me and I hope this blog post will inspire you to run a marathon in the future!</p>
